# 104PerceptronSingleLayerModelImplementation_OOPsConcept_DeepLearning

I tried to implement perceptron model using OOPs Concept. I took CancerDataset of sklearn for this implementation. 

### Steps:
1. import Linbraries
2. load the breast cancer data
3. convert the data to pandas dataframe
4. plotting a graph to see class imbalance
5. Separate the data for target and featurers by their names
6. train test split
7. create NeuralNetwork class
8. intialize variables in class
9. activation function and threshold function
10. feed-forward network
11. backpropagation network to update weights
12. train the neural net for 25,000 iterations
13. function to predict output on new and unseen input data
14. Train neural network 
15. Testing the Network
16. plotting the graph between error and epoches
17. Calculate Accuracy
